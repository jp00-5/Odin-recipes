          <li>Step 1:
            In a large plate or mixing bowl add 2 cups maida, 1 teaspoon sugar, salt as needed.
             Roughly mix it together and make a well in the center.
          </li>

          <li>Step 2:
            Knead into a soft pliable dough. Add 1 tablespoon oil on top.
          </li>

          <li>Step 3:
            Now knead the dough using this special kneading technique as shown below. 
            Push the dough using the thumb finger and keep repeating this multiple times until it is soft & smooth.
          </li>

          <li>Step 4:
            Add 2 tablespoon oil on top of the kneaded dough and cover it with a damp kitchen towel.
             Rest it for 2 hours at the least.
          </li>

          <li>Step 5:
            Now we will make ‘beeda’ which is making balls out of the dough.
             Push the dough between the thumb & index finger – it should come out in a smooth ball. 
            Twist it remove it.
          </li>

          <li>Step 6:
            Heat a pan on medium flame and keep it on low heat once hot. Place the prepared parotta and drizzle a teaspoon of oil around the edges.

          </li>

          <li>Step 7:
            Serve hot with Salna or Kurma with a side of thayir pachadi/onion raita. If not serving immediately, store them in hotpack/hotbox to retain the softness.
             You can also freeze the cooked parottas in ziplock bags for upto few weeks.
